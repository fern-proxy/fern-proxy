# Cloud Native high performance security and privacy SQL proxy

Work in progress... ‚è≥

For the time being, development in Fern proxy focuses on implementing core
features to support and provide value in a PostgreSQL datastore scenario.
Wire protocols and abstractions allowing other datastores will come later.
Same goes for deployment and optimizations leveraging DaemonSets and eBPF.

Feel free to contribute! üëç

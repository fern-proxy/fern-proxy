# Reporting Security Issues

Thinking you found a security vulnerability?
Let's talk and take a responsible disclosure path together.

The Fern project team has adopted this security disclosure and response policy
to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

First and foremost:

* Security issues should be reported privately via [team@fernproxy.io](mailto:team@fernproxy.io).
* Security issues should not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.

For the time being, **Fern proxy is definitely not ready yet for production**.
Therefore, it _should really not_ be used in production, and any reported
security issue _should really not_ have any impact on end-users.

As the Fern project team is committed to transparency in the security issue
disclosure process, in the future this policy will be amended to detail
vulnerability coordination, for example leveraging
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/code-security/repository-security-advisories/).
